# About

This is my first PowerShell project, I previously have done some coding in C# and that experience mixes fairly well with PowerShell. In future projects I plan to use more of PowerShell's custom objects and object-oriented structure. No code is copied from other PowerShell Hangman projects.

# How to Play

Select all of the code (CTRL+A) and copy (CTRL+C) it. Then paste (CTRL+V) the code into PowerShell and press Enter. To escape out of the game early, press CTRL+C. 

# Future Additons

Make the program into a cmdlet and allow the following to be piped in as parameters:
- A dictionary of words stored in a text file
- A theme of the dictionary

# Possible Additons
